## About

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+ / macOS 10.11+
- XCode 10.0+
- Swift 4.2+

## Features

- [x] Codable support.
- [x] Built-in Alamofire driver.
- [x] Built-in URLSession driver.
- [x] PromiseKit wrapper.
- [ ] Automatic request parameter serialization (Codable?)

## Driver coverage

The following table describes how much the specific drivers cover `SessionManager` defined in the Core of RestBird.

|                         | Coverage |
|-------------------------|----------|
| AlamofireSessionManager | 100%     |
| URLSessionManager       | 70%      |

## Installation Instructions

### Swift Package Manager

Add RestBird as a dependency to your project.

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/halcyonmobile/RestBird.git", majorVersion: 0, minorVersion: 3)
```

You can use RestBird and implement your own session handling or use one of the built-in drivers implemented by RestBird (Alamofire and URLSession).

```swift
// Use RestBird without any driver
targets: [
    Target(name: "YourTarget", dependencies: ["RestBird"])
]

// Use the URLSession Driver
targets: [
    Target(name: "YourTarget", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "RestBird-URLSession", package: "RestBird")
    ])
]

// Use the Alamofire Driver
targets: [
    Target(name: "YourTarget", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "RestBird-Alamofire", package: "RestBird")
    ])
]
```

### CocoaPods

```ruby
# use RestBird without any driver
pod 'RestBird'

# use RestBird with Alamofire driver
pod 'RestBird/Alamofire'

# use RestBird with URLSession driver
pod 'RestBird/URLSession'
```

You can also try it out by running

```bash
pod try RestBird
```

### Carthage

```swift
github "halcyonmobile/RestBird"
```

## Setup

Steps for setting up the project for development:
- Clone the repo
- Generate Xcode project by executing `swift package generate-xcodeproj`
- Open project

## Usage

First you need to create your `NetworkClientConfiguration` configuration with your custom or one of the provided session manager drivers. We're going to use the AlamofireSessionManager.

```swift
struct MainAPIConfiguration: NetworkClientConfiguration {
    let baseUrl = "https://api.example.com"
    let sessionManager = AlamofireSessionManager()
}
```

Now we can pass this configuration to the network client.

```swift
let networkClient = NetworkClient(configuration: MainAPIConfiguration())
```

In order to make requests, a `DataRequest` object should be defined.

```swift
struct SignIn: DataRequest {
    typealias ResponseType = Authentication

    let email: String
    let password: String

    let suffix: String? = API.Path.login
    let method: HTTPMethod = .post
    var parameters: [String : Any]? {
        return [API.Param.email: email, API.Param.password: password]
    }
}
```

Now use your network client to execute requests.

```swift
let request = SignIn(email: "john-doe@acme.inc", password: "123456")
networkClient.execute(request: request, completion: { result: Result<Authentication> in 
    print(result)
})
```

## Convenience

You can find convenience wrappers for RestBird which are not distributed through the package. This includes a PromiseKit wrapper.
