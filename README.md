## About

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+ / macOS 10.11+
- XCode 10.0+
- Swift 4.2+

## Features

- [x] Codable support.
- [ ] Built-in Alamofire driver.
- [ ] Built-in URLSession driver.

## Installation Instructions

### Swift Package Manager

Add RestBird as a dependency to your project.

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/halcyonmobile/RestBird.git", majorVersion: 1)
```

You can use RestBird and implement your own session handling or use one of the built-in drivers implemented by RestBird (Alamofire and URLSession).

```swift
// Use RestBird without any driver
targets: [
    Target(name: "YourTarget", dependencies: ["RestBird"])
]

// Use the URLSession Driver
targets: [
    Target(name: "YourTarget", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "RestBird-URLSession", package: "RestBird")
    ])
]

// Use the Alamofire Driver
targets: [
    Target(name: "YourTarget", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "RestBird-Alamofire", package: "RestBird")
    ])
]
```

### CocoaPods

```ruby
# use RestBird without any driver
pod 'RestBird'

# use RestBird with Alamofire driver
por 'RestBird/Alamofire'
```

You can also try it out by running

```bash
pod try RestBird
```

### Carthage

```swift
github "halcyonmobile/RestBird"
```

## Usage

First you need to create your `NetworkClientConfiguration` configuration with your custom or one of the provided session manager drivers. We're going to use the AlamofireSessionManager.

```swift
struct MainAPIConfiguration: NetworkClientConfiguration {
    let baseUrl = "https://api.example.com"
    let sessionManager = AlamofireSessionManager()
}
```

Now we can pass this configuration to the network client.

```swift
let networkClient = NetworkClient(configuration: MainAPIConfiguration())
```
